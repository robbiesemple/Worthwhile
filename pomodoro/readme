this is a readme file

first function for this site will be to record blocks of activity, and information about the blocks; with a view to reporting on them. 
There will be 3 pages - a schedule page; a completed page; and a reporting page.

The information recorded will be:
The name of the block
The date and time it is completed
the objective under which it sits (sales, grads 15/16 etc.)
the stage it is at (scheduled; in progress; completed)

this is a test line for pushing local changes to remote repo
